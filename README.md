# Threadbox

This repository contains 3D-printable models to make an arcade controller shell that looks like this:

This design replaces the need to screw directly into the material of the shell with a system of hex nuts and torx screws. By making the screws come out of the front, nice and flush, the two halves of the shell are pressed together by the hardware. This way, no glueing, post processing, modding, or any kind of work is needed to fasten your shell together! When you are ready to assemble your controller, simply drop a hex nut into one of the holes on the back shell, hold it in place with your finger, and then screw it together from the other side.

If you would like, you can also simply and easily add a little drop of glue into each of the holes for the hex nuts. This will keep the parts in place permanently and allow you to take apart your controller and put it back together without ever fiddling with the back shell. This way, you can install a non-slip pad onto the bottom of your threadbox, covering up the holes and improving the look and feel of your controller, without having to remove the pad when you want to take the controller apart.
